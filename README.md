# skyro

Do you love the scikit-learn API and numpyro, but struggle to use them in conjunction? Well, look no further
then. This library provides a lightweight wrapper for numpyro models using scikit-learn (like) API via the great 
[skbase](https://github.com/sktime/skbase). 

## Installation

skyro is currently not released on PyPI but might be in the future. So to install, copy and paste the following

```commandline
pip install git+https://github.com/tingiskhan/skyro
```

## Examples
See the [examples](./examples) section.

## Disclaimer
Note that this project is not endorsed, affiliated or supported by either the numpyro, sktime or scikit-learn 
developers, the name is just a mash-up.
